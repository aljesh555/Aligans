# Aligans Project - Prompt History

## Prompt 1: Project Setup and Requirements
```
This system will manage sports product sales, multi-branch inventory, HR/staff operations, team/event registration, and customer orders. Products are categorized and stock is maintained per branch. Customers can shop online, add multiple items to a cart, and place orders. The platform will also support organizing sports events and registering teams (local to national level) with player details. HR functions include employee roles, attendance, and salary records. The system is scalable, multi-branch-ready, and role-based for admin, manager, staff, and customers.

## Prompt 2: Project Structure Creation
```
now.. create 4 folders.. 
1. laravel api server
2. mobile/flutter application
3. admin dashboard
4. web application, SPA

all folders should be inside this D:/aligans.. if you are missing any dependencies while doing the installations, just go ahead and install them..

when you are done, i'd like to see 4 folders, with applications inside of them.

and as you go, log the progress in AIProgress.txt file, on this directory, so that if you get interruped, you can continue from where you left off.
```
